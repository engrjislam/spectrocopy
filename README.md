# spectrocopy
This is one most interesting academic project I have done in University of Oulu 


## Description

A very simple graphical user interface to plot spectroscopy.
    
In electron spectroscopy matter is examined by radiating it with a bright light and measuring the kinetic energy of electrons that come off it. When the photonic energy of light and kinetic energy of the electrons are known, they can be used to derive the amount of force that was required to break off the electrons. This provides valuable information about the matter's electron structure, and its chemical and physical properties. This phenomenon where photons break off electrons is called photoionization, and the broken off electrons are called photoelectrons.
    
This project requires two third party libraries: numpy and matplotlib. There are multiple ways to install them. Windows installers     can be found for both, and can also be installed them using pip. There are also various full stack installers available in the internet (full stack means they install Python along with a bunch of libraries, usually replacing "generic" Python installation).
